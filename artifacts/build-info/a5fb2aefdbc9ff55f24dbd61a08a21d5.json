of the {IERC20} interface.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification. Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance} functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting allowances.

Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `amount`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `amount`.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/Token.sol\":\"Token\"},\"evmVersion\":\"london\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":1000},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xa56ca923f70c1748830700250b19c61b70db9a683516dc5e216694a50445d99c\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://cac938788bc4be12101e59d45588b4e059579f4e61062e1cda8d6b06c0191b15\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmV2JKCyjTVH3rkWNrfdJRhAT7tZ3usAN2XcnD4h53Mvih\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x287b55befed2961a7eabd7d7b1b2839cbca8a5b80ef8dcbb25ed3d4c2002c305\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://bd39944e8fc06be6dbe2dd1d8449b5336e23c6a7ba3e8e9ae5ae0f37f35283f5\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPV3FGYjVwvKSgAXKUN3r9T9GwniZz83CxBpM7vyj2G53\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8de418a5503946cabe331f35fe242d3201a73f67f77aaeb7110acb1f30423aca\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://5a376d3dda2cb70536c0a45c208b29b34ac560c4cb4f513a42079f96ba47d2dd\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZQg6gn1sUpM8wHzwNvSnihumUCAhxD119MpXeKp8B9s8\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe2e337e6dde9ef6b680e07338c493ebea1b5fd09b43424112868e9cc1706bca7\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6df0ddf21ce9f58271bdfaa85cde98b200ef242a05a3f85c2bc10a8294800a92\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmRK2Y5Yc6BK7tGKkgsgn3aJEQGi5aakeSPZvS65PV8Xp3\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x3088eb2868e8d13d89d16670b5f8612c4ab9ff8956272837d8e90106c59c14a0\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b81d9ff6559ea5c47fc573e17ece6d9ba5d6839e213e6ebc3b4c5c8fe4199d7f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPCW1bFisUzJkyjroY3yipwfism9RRCigCcK1hbXtVM8n\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x809bc3edb4bcbef8263fa616c1b60ee0004b50a8a1bfa164d8f57fd31f520c58\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://8b93a1e39a4a19eba1600b92c96f435442db88cac91e315c8291547a2a7bcfe2\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmTm34KVe6uZBZwq8dZDNWwPcm24qBJdxqL3rPxBJ4LrMv\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe4455ac1eb7fc497bb7402579e7b4d64d928b846fce7d2b6fde06d366f21c2b3\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://cc8841b3cd48ad125e2f46323c8bad3aa0e88e399ec62acb9e57efa7e7c8058c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmSqE4mXHA2BXW58deDbXE8MTcsL5JSKNDbm23sVQxRLPS\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SignedMath.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf92515413956f529d95977adc9b0567d583c6203fc31ab1c23824c35187e3ddc\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c50fcc459e49a9858b6d8ad5f911295cb7c9ab57567845a250bf0153f84a95c7\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmcEW85JRzvDkQggxiBBLVAasXWdkhEysqypj9EaB6H2g6\"]},\"contracts/Token.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd8b3d5970b9e7effb1c606a2e75c8032dcadbe84f1595cfa7c413049a14d7c82\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://3466e46faf541a64bcfff6c500c3f3b397790a5947bbde01ed636d4ba8b16227\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmRWhkuMzK96MQhMq9z3kazSMU9upgo8LskYxvRS9xbCfh\"]}},\"version\":1}"}}}}}
